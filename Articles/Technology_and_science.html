    <h3 id="topic">Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology and Science</h3>
    <section id="content">
    <p>Shakespeare once wrote, "It is excellent to have a giant's strength, but tyrannous use it as a giant". This is also true in the world of <b>science.</b> There is always a big question what are the advantages and disadvantages of science and technology. So answer is here. S is neither a curse nor a blessing. Everything depends on its usage. Science as a servant in many ways is truly a blessing for us humans. It is a curse if we use it as our master. We live in the age of science. It has changed the face of our world. Scientific inventions like <b>computers,satellites,mobiles,photography and obviously robots</b> have proved to be very useful. All these scientific inventions have a great usage. Today, man can fly in the air like a bird and swim in the ocean or underwater like a fish. These have been possible due to the hard and continuous work of the scientist. We truly stand <acronym title="grateful to someone">indebted</acronym> to them</p>
    <p>Now let's check how technology can serve as a good servant: </p>

    <p><b>Electricity:</b> It is one of the invaluable gifts of science.It has proved to be a boon in the modern world. It has saved us from unnecessary <acronym title="doing hard work for a long time">toil</acronym>. The invention of electricity has made our life easier. It keeps our rooms warm, moves our fans. It even boils water for us.Thus it has proved to be very helpful in an <acronym title="anything which can't be counted">uncountable</acronym> way.<p>
        <p><b> Means of communication: </b> Wireless, telegraph and telephone are very useful. Telephone and telegraph are the fastest means of sending news and information from and place to another. Wireless has done wonders</p>
        <p><b> Means of communication: </b> Wireless, telegraph and telephone are very useful.Telephone and telegraph are the fastest means of sending news and information from and place to another. Wireless has done wonders</p>
        <p><b> Medicines: </b> In the medical fields, since drugs have been invented, have become pretty popular and useful. A <acronym title="a person who is liable to cry">weeping person</acronym> begins to smile due to it.Many <acronym title="">fatal </acronym>diseases can now be cured. Even at present entire human organ can be changed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Technology has some disadvantages also. There is also a dark picture of it. So now let's see how technology can be misused: <br><br>
         &#9679; Machines are very useful but they also are the main reason for unemployment. <br>  &#9679; Means of communication can be used for war  <acronym title="An information that can be false , majorly used by a political leader,party etc."> propaganda.</acronym> <br>  &#9679; Machines even causes infections and give birth to many unknown diseases. <br>  &#9679; Science has given destructive weapons of war. The fearful picture of <acronym title=" On 6 August 1945"> Hiroshima and Nagasaki</acronym> and that of Gulf-war is before us <br>  &#9679; Nuclear weapons can destroy in a moment what takes centuries to build. </p>
         <p> Thus we can say that science has destroyed man's faith in god. It has made man <acronym title="concerned more with material things than with spiritual values">materialistic</acronym>. He has forgotten human values. His god is only money. Thus, we even see that <b>"Science has brought both heaven and hell to the world of man."</b> Science has given eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, tongue to the dumb, and of course limbs to the <acronym title="one who is no longer able to walk properly">cripple</acronym>. Now It is for the man to choose his place of living....</p>
