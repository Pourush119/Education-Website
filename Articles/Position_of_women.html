        <h3 id="topic">Position of women in society</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p><b>Women - the word itself tells us that they are superior to men.</b> It is wo + men, means they are above men from their title itself. Women occupy a major part of society. She is a soul who has burden of almost everyone in the family. She raises the future of the nation and balances the present of the nation. She seems to be the major wheel of life. I think that there should be no question about the position of women in the community. But still some orthodox like to pose women as inferior. They don't even once consider to themselves that on whom they are putting a question mark. Anyways women are always superior. In ancient times women used to have an honorable position in society. They were equal partners of men in every field of life. If we see today then Sita, Savitri, and Ganga seem to be the pillars of present society. If it was so than from where the tradition of women considering inferior began ?</p>
            <p>It began during Muslim    rule in India. Women during this time lost their position of honor and right to equality. They were kept within the four walls of the house. Doors of education were now closed for them. Different rules were imposed on them. They had to cover up their face in front of their elders and their major duty was to serve and obey the husband, her father-in-law, and mother-in-law. Following tradition continued for many years. But soon after independence, their position began to lift in the society. Indian constitution considers men and women equal now. They are truly on the road to progress. Doors of education again opened for them and they started ruling the education system. Rather than indulging themselves in household work only, they started to participate in all kinds of professions. It is now wrong to say that more than half of the community depends upon women. If we just have a look at the position of women in present India. We still find that except in some places their position is still not sound. In homes and outside their exploitation is at peak. Even in metropolitan cities, we see that cases of rape,molestation, etc are increasing at a very high rate. Even at workplaces, they are not secure. Dowry system is still a part of modern society. They are surrounded by evils.</p>
            <p>Thus, it would be not wrong to say no nation can progress without progress of condition of women. And India needs to work a lot on this. People should once think before carrying out evils on women. If it happens to be true then definitely our country shall start progressing at max rate....</p>
