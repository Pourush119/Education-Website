        <h3 id="topic">Change is constant-My Experience</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>The wheel of time has turned and I now stand on the threshold of adult life. Having spent the better part of my life in this school, which has been my second home, I now realize nostalgically what a chunk of my life I am leaving behind. I become overwhelmed with emotions and sentiments as I think of leaving schools, my teachers, my dear friends.</p>
            <p>This school has been full of experiences for me be it good or bad. I got enrolled in this school I was four years old clinging to my mother's hand but I would like to thank the teachers present here for not only helping me to adjust to his new environment but also motivating me and constantly guiding me to achieve my goals. We all have been singing our college anthem, 'The outskirts of my town...' I hope my friends may remember it? When I was a small child, I was unaware of the meaning of its words, all I knew was that I had to stand in its honor but now when I am on the verge of leaving this school I know the meaning of every word, the words are true engraved in my heart.</p>
            <p>My school through its disciplinary rules has helped me to differentiate between right and wrong, and contributed a lot to my personality development, and carved me into a better human. Whenever we think about education we think about calculations in maths, laws of the universe in Physics, chemical reactions in chemistry, the study of bodily process in Biology but we forget the main aim of education, being human! We got so much immersed in Science and Maths that we tend to lose our emotions towards fellow humans and things. We need to be human rather than a human being this is what which differentiates us from animals. Education inculcates mutual understanding, humanity, and respect for each other. </p>
            <p>We shouldn't forget our roots, especially the roots of education which connect us from the Earth. I admit these roots/experiences are bitter but always remember only these roots provide growth to the tree and in the later years are instrumental in bearing sweet and healthy fruit. Teachers are always referred to as potters who carve the minds of children into beautiful shapes. I think and I want my juniors to always respect teachers then we should also have the courage to accept our faults. The advice given by our teachers should be given topmost priority! The advice given by our teachers are tailored for our benefit and should be taken graciously.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I would like to give a message to my juniors, be righteous in your actions, dignified in your ways, be good to people on your way up. They will help you in case you tumble down; belief in your teachers and you yourself. The future lies before you, dear friends on it, for every mark will show!</p>
