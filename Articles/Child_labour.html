        <h3 id="topic">Child Labour: an obstacle of future</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>The famous Chinese thinker<b> Confucious said "Life without children on earth will become hell".</b> This
                even holds a true picture. The house where children do not laugh or quarrel looks dull. Such is the importance of children. Children are truly flowers of family. More than a century back,<b>Katherine Mayo said "India is a rich country where poor people lives."</b> Here in India on account of poverty the condition of children is pityful. They are
                ill-treated and ill-fed. A hungry man eats everything he find's near him. So to satisfy their hunger, the young children are sent to serve the rich as servants. Even for their work, they are not paid much. Even after working at playing age, they fail to escape from suffering. They are deprived of education. They remain ill-literate.
            Books are simply strangers to them. Actually, who will care for education when the stomach is empty?
            Their days pass in worries. They have no joy in their life and as a result, their outlook becomes
          pessimistic. When a child between the age of 6 and 15 is employed his life becomes hellish. He has to work more than hours a day. He is abused and misused. Some times he is beaten mercilessly. A child working in a hotel suffers the most. He is the first to get up and is the last to go to bed. He cannot grumble for fear of being
        beaten up. For a slight mistake, he is showered with abuses. He does not even know the efficacy of good words. But does it affect these innocent children only? No,i  feel that their deteriorate condition is major reason for country's slow
        development. Hands of children which they should use to play with soft toys are begging. Now here a point catches, is it the problem of the whole world. The answer is yes but India is the biggest example of facing the problem of child labor. It's truly a national shame that the bulk of people still suffer. Although constitution of India doesn't allow us to carry out such practice . These corrupted men do not respect the children of the lower section rather than exploit them. But who cares about the constitution, everybody has eyes on their own profit. The government should also be blamed for this. Indians just make laws to be written in books not to be implemented practically. <b>I think that if the government begins to care for these children then definitely in the future they would become the next Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos....</b></p>
