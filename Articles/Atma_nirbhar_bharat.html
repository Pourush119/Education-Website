                <section id="content">
                    <p>In words of former indian prime minister PM Smt.Indra Gandhi</p>
                    <p><b>"A nation's strength ultimately consists in what it can do on its own not on in what it can do by depending on some external affair"</b></p>
                    <p>The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a global health crisis that has a deep impact on the way we perceive our world and our everday lives. It has effected out country a lot. The economic impact of the pandemic has been largely destructive. India's growth in the court quarter of the fiscal year 2020 went down to 3.1% according to the Ministry of Statistics. However the pandemic time has given us an oppourtinity to become self-reliant. Yes a self reliant India!! Our ultimate goal of <b>Aatma Nirbhar Bharat</b> can be acheived. Hearing the idea only fills our heart with glory, i imagine if it be true in future then for indians it would "Heaven down to Earth." Although we have been hearing this since the last centuary that the 21st century belong to India. As the situation after the crisis unfurl in the world, this dream rather becomes a possibility. The country's self reliance is the key factor for its developmental boost. The present circumstances of the world edify us that a self reliant India is the only path of India's prosperity. </p>
                    <p><b>Now let's check what actually the idea of digital india is and how does this boost the idea of self-reliant India ?</b></p>
                    <p>The digital India programme was launched on <b>1st August 2015</b> by our honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. But first let's undertsand what digital india programme is. Digital India is a flagship program of the government of India with a vision to transform India into a digiatlly empowered society and knowledge economy</p>. India too has bright minds in the field of Information Technology who are fueled by top institutions of the country like IIT's. So there is a great need of creating a plan to encourage foreign companies to Inida and settling up our own companis. This will enable our self-sufficiency. Also digitalization has not been enabled in most of the villages and remote areas of the country. Thus this program was launched to enable digitalization in every nook and corner of the country. Hence the main aim of Digital India is to transform India's Talent to its bright future by the means of information technology.</p>
                    <p>Apart from this the possibility of becoming a atamnirbhar bharat increases due to the posed opportunities by COVID-19 for digitally self-reliant India.</p>
                    <p>The COVID-19 crisis is an unprecedent one in he history of mankind. It has created a trail of destruction on economic, medical and political fronts. However during the time of crisis India has emerged as a global leader addressing the issue domestically and internationally quite efficiently. India has emerged as a global leader addressing the issue domestically and internationally quite efficiently. India's selfless work to save humanity at large scale has gained limelight of leaders acrosss the globe. This acknowledgement by the world leaders will help India gain strategic benefits at global level especially in the fields of cybernetics and information technology. Over the past six years program like <b>Digital India and Make in India</b> have already geared the digiatl development and earned business in Inida. The government should take bold steps to capture and utilize this short window. Self-Reliance in IT and hardware sector will bring ougt amazing outcomes. Setting up of induatries and MNCs would crete large number of job opportunities within countries and would also reduce dependence on foreign products. It would also increase the export of products from India building up the economy. However self-reliance does not connote self-centredness. India's self-reliance is entrenched with the whole world's happiness,coperation and peace because <b>"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"</b>, i.e. the whole world is family. The crisis has limited offline operations and given a scope for a digital world. It is the time for India to emerge as a Global Digital Giant with the coperation of other countries across the world, to emerge as a self-reliant country.</p>
                    <p><b>Duke Ellington said "A problem is a chance for you to do the best."</b> So this is the time for us to emerge as a self-sufficient country and a global leader to drive the world out ti new sunshine from th ecrissi. The dream of Atma Nirbhar Bharat should thrive in the hearts of every Indian. Self-reliant,self-standing and emerging as a global leader and that's truly will be the India of our dreams. This time, as a citizen of India, let's pledge to make it happen......</p>
