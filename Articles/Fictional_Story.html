        <section id="content">
            <p>I feel like surrounded by science fiction from my very young days. From the teacher's stories to my mother's courageous speeches. Everywhere I feel, I am with fiction all time. I even once had day-dreamed my days as a fictional character. More precisely dreamed of being a fictional superhero like Spiderman, Captain America, Superman, or that giant-red Hulk. But today when i used to think of my <i>Past Fictional beliefs</i> i laugh. But I still feel the idea of being a boy with superpowers was great. To date, sometimes I think of my life as an extraordinary life of a Superhero. I know it seems a little weird for a teen to think so. But sadly, I can't do anything because my society has always made me surround by fiction. I still remember my days when I was 10  and I used to spend my whole day reading those superhero stories. I used to read 6-7 comics a day. I continued reading fictional stories till my nearest library owner told me that I have read all the fictional books they have. Those days my parents didn't allow me to buy comics and today I have a fear of being laughed at by my wife and friends on the thought of buying comics. </p>
            <p>Leave my present, let's throw more light on my fictional world that my imaginations had created around me. I always wanted to be Spiderman, sometimes Batman or maybe Tony Stark...Iron-Man. Confused about which superhero to be. But I more loved the idea of all the superheroes which every superhero possesses. I always knew if I had them I would have done various mischiefs. Although I know that if somebody gives me powers then he would surely give me a big list of rules to follow. As with every fictional story, I would definitely not follow them in the first few days but soon will be remembered of my duties as it happens in every story. </p>
            <p>Now let's narrate the story I have imagined when I was 11. I had superpowers for one complete month. And a lot happened in that happened. I will tell you what happened. Superpowers I had were: Superspeed like <b>"FLASH"</b>, ability to fly like "SUPERMAN" and more importantly ability to do those powerful energy blasts like "CAPTAIN MARVEL". But I didn't get those from "TESSERACT". But I got the capability to do energy blast with the SUPERDURABLE SUIT OF my favorite "IRON-MAN'. Also i had the super strength of "Hulk". First, I definitely wanted to win the race competitions in my school using my Superspeed. I used my Superspeed and won three competitions. Eventually, I got a bad tick on my superhero profile. From there I became a good superhero as every non-boring superhero story says. Hopefully, in mine, there wasn't any AGENT COLSON involved. On a serious note with my superspeed, I caught a gang of 6 thieves which managed to escape from the cops in a fraction of seconds. I also used my powerful energy blast to catch those thieves. Also another time I saved a child falling from the top of LA apartments. Here surely I used my flying superpower. I think my readers must be thinking why I had so accurate powers? Don,t worry they will get the answer. Now I mention the biggest alien attack on my city. There where a superhero who is needed most. Everyone was scared to see those big alien ships and were waiting for their superhero to come and save them. I took a grand entry in the field as I was all set for a <b>"UNIVERSAL FIGHT"</b> with these aliens. I think I forgot to describe alines. They were giant jelly-like brown-black creatures. Some were like mad dogs who didn't care about their lives. I had a great fight with them and thank god I had superdurable <b>"MARK 86"</b> which saved me from their attack to great extent. I won and winning was obvious because that was my fictional story. Some after that heavy attack mighty power has taken my powers back saying - <i>"SOME OTHER TIME BOY"</i></p>
            <p>Even today I feel quite sad thinking why mighty power took powers back from me. But sadder and a little angry about the fact that the might power was my imagination. I always love to think of one of the greatest fictional stuff composed by my imagination. I tell this story to my kids today and they question me why aliens attacked my city only why not on complete Earth?</p>
