    <h3 id="topic">Importance of sports and games</h3>
    <section id="content">
        <p>Our body is like a machine. A machine can not continue to work effectively without oiling. In the same way, our body can not work properly without exercise, games, and sports. They are <acronym title="something that makes you feel stronger,healthier">tonic</acronym> for health. Generally, some people believe that these popular games and sports are only a wastage of time and spoil children. The common saying "Master in the field, zero in the class", <acronym title="to stop someone from doing something by making him realize that it won't be a good idea">discourages</acronym> sports. But we must remember that "All work no play makes jack a dull boy." Thus games and sports are as important as food, work, and worship. Games and sports are as old as human civilization itself. I think everybody really need to understand the value of sports. The history of sports life like hunting, horse racing, boxing is very ancient. In modern times we can see many forms of games and sports like <b>cricket, hockey, volleyball, football, etc.</b> They are organized at every level like school, state, national and international.</p>
        <p>We are students. It is our duty to study but we can not study for continuous hours. There is a limitation to our energy. Doing too much work of the same type makes a person <acronym title="not interested by personal feelings">disinterested.</acronym> Without interest <acronym title="It is the peak level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output">efficiency</acronym> declines. Thus, a life full of worries is a curse. It eats up all the charms of our life. It makes us dull and boring. For studies, we should be healthy. A weak and sick student can not study properly. Good health makes work better. Regular exercise makes a sportsman active, strong, and healthy physically as well as mentally. The limbs move and blood circulates. So the body functions better. Health is the basis of success. According to Hindu dharma shastra, four rare gifts for a man are <b>health, wealth, obedient sons, and virtuous wife.</b> When health is so important we must try to preserve it by indulging in games and sports. So it is correctly quoted "If wealth is lost, nothing is lost if health is lost, something most precious is lost."</p>
        <p>Thus we can say that games and sports make us <acronym title=" a trained person to obey and to behave in a controlled way">disciplined</acronym>. They keep machine-like human-life work smoothly. They teach us team spirit. We learn to adjust with others. They teach us <acronym title="working together with somebody else to achieve something">co-operation.</acronym> They develop the spirit of self-sacrifice. Thus games have also a moral and social value. Sports are important but not at the cost of work. So, a balanced view is necessary because it is true, "A sound mind lives in a sound body...."</p>
