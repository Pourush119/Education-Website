        <h3 id="topic">Cloud Computing</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>The term <b>"Cloud Computing"</b> is everywhere. In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the internet.</p>
            <p>Uses of the cloud include data storage, offering remote access to any work-related data. The role of cloud computing on a corporate level can be either for the in house operations or as a deployment tool for software or services the company develops for the public.</p>
            <p><b>CLOUD COMPUTING EDUCATION:</b></p>
            <p>The benefits of cloud computing is being recognized in businesses and institutions across the board, with almost 90 percent of organizations currently using some kind of cloud-based application. The immediate benefits of cloud computing are obvious. Cloud-based applications reduce infrastructure and IT costs, increase accessibility, enable collaboration, and allow organizations more flexibility in customizing their products both for their brand and for their audience. But cloud computing is having other effects as well, which have the potential to greatly change how education works, both in online courses and in traditional classrooms.</p>
            <p><b>HERE ARE 5 SURPRISING WAYS CLOUD COMPUTING IS REVOLUTIONIZING EDUCATION:</b></p>
            <P>1. No more expensive textbooks. It's no secret that university-level textbooks are expensive. As a result, many students are simply refusing to buy them. Cloud-Based textbooks can solve this problem as digital content is significantly less expensive than printed content. Currently, higher education institutions across the United States are piloting an e-textbook program involving 50 publishers and close to 30,000 textbooks.</P>
            <p>2. No more outdated learning materials. The problem of expensive textbooks means that many of the materials students are using are outdated. With cutbacks in school budgets, many districts, especially in less affluent areas, simply can't afford to replace these outdated resources. Cloud-Based materials are easy to update in real-time so that students always have access to the most current learning resources.</p>
            <p>3. No expensive hardware is required. Cloud-based applications can be run on internet browsers, but most are compatible with mobile devices as well. This means that schools and students do not necessarily need to own expensive computers. Students also don't need to purchase external storage devices as there are plenty of companies, like Google, that offer free Cloud-Based storage.</p>
            <p>4. No expensive software is required. One of the biggest advantages of Cloud-Based computing opens up a world of new possibilities for students, especially those who are not served well by traditional education systems.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>In these and other ways, cloud computing is not only reducing costs but also creating an environment where all students can have access to high-quality education and resources. Whether you are an administrator, a teacher, a student, or the parent of a student, now is a great time to explore how Cloud-Based applications can benefit us, our children, and our schools......</p>
