His team included one of his senior Nawab of Pataudi and famous Dhyan Chand . Due to the excellent game of Jaipal Singh, his team easily won all the matches but unfortunately, he could not play the finals as he had to return to London back due to his ICS final exams. His team made history by winning the first-ever Olympic gold by beating Holland with 3-0. The hallmarks of his game as a defender were excellent tackling, sensible gameplay and well-directed hard hits. He too was the most versatile player in Oxford University hockey team. His contribution to the university hockey team was recognized and he became the first Indian student to be conferred blue in hockey. He becamehumilated because despite of scoring highest marks in ICS exam, he was told to repeat a year as he has broken the rule by joining the Olympics, so due to this he refused and ended his professional career. He then took up job as senior executive. Then he moved to Ghana and within the other three years, he returned to India. In 1937, he took a job as a principal at Rajkumar College in Raipur. But due to the outrage of the prince, Jaipal Singh was forced to resign. After moving here and there for years, he finally decided to return to his hometown, Ranchi.

            <p><b>"What my people require, sir is not adequate safeguards...They require protection from the ministers. We do not ask for special protection. We want to be treated to be like other Indians."</b></p>
            <p>He also had worked a lot in the sphere of education. He wrote many letters to Dr.Rajnendra Prasad, asking him to help in Bihar Education sector,but unfortunately his letter got denied. So, he continued his works for the upliftment of tribal. Jaipal Singh Munda Continued to work for his tribal till his last breath in 1970. It was very sad for him when he saw his dream of equality not coming true for tribes as they remain a work of progress. </p>
