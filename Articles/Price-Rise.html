        <h3 id="topic">Price-Rise: common problem</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>Price rise or Price-Hike is a very serious problem in this world. Today, my country faces several problems, but the most serious problem is that of Price-Rise. Its reason is directly related to the common masses. Nowadays problem of Price-Rise is very acute throughout the world. But its effects are very disastrous as about 30%
                people are living below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The present condition is highly serious. The common people are passing their life under the heavy burden of problem of Price-Rise. They can not make both ends meet. The problem of food, clothing, and shelter is never present before all. The service class people find it very difficult to pass one month with their low income. The poor are caught in the net of poverty, debt, and .</p>
                    <p>Now let's look why there is always an increase in prices. There is not a single reason rather piles of reason.
                        First is the rising population which is the root cause of every problem. It is one of the important causes.
                        Population growth has checked all our efforts in progress. Increasing population too has become a very big problem in Price-Rise. The production can not keep pace with the growth of the population. The demand is more than the supply. So the prices go up to the peak of the mountains.
                    </p>
                    <p>Secondly, black-marketers and middle-men are antisocial
                        elements. They take advantage of people's sufferings. They are very greedy. They can do everything for their greed. They have no concious. They desire to earn more and more; what maybe they don't care. Whenever there is some shortage of anything vedors hoard it and sell it at their own rate. </p>
                        <p>The improper planning of government is also a cause of increase in prices or Price-Rise. The government plans are more theoretical and less practical.
                        A great deal of money and mind is wasted for nothing. The plans are not made in view of needs and
                        economy of the country.Black-Money 
                            is the root cause of this evil i.e. Price-Rise.</p>
                        <p>Every  suffers but the people
                            of low income suffers most. They find it hard to make their both ends meet. So,they lead a miserable life. Price-Rise do not effect the rich people much as they
                            care the fortunesfavourites.</p>
                            <p>Different means of family planningsd be put into practise to check the rising population.
                                Production should be increased more and more. A ban should be put by the government on black marketing
                                and ,most
                                popular economic evils of our society.  Deficit
                                financing should be reduced as far as possible. If we see in present scenario than COVID-19 has also played a major role in Price-Hike</p>
                            <p>Thus,we can say that the problem of Price-Rise which is a very common problem need to be resolved as soon as possible
                                by active co-operation of men and women. This is a serious threat and it must be figured out with
                                immediate actions....</p>
