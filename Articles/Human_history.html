        <h3 id="topic">Human Origin: unsolved mystery</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>Where do we come from? Where are we going? Or like What's our history? These are the most intriguing questions of human existence, here on Earth. These questions have been the most important to answer, even by the stalwarts of their generations. However, if we ponder over it, critically enough, we can understand its significance and essentially its meaning, but the roots of origin are for away from the realms of minds to understand. However, it is not IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
            <p>So, we created human beings, or what made them. Some believe that a mighty creator came upon the Earth, created humans, provided them profusely with the elements for their survival, and then simply left.</p>
            <p>To think of a mighty being, who created the universe let alone a single one, seems for too absurd. However, there is a possibility, but there's no sure and it seems as the work of people who gave went to their ingenuity andavarice , and tried to work on the minds of their fellow beings. But if this is not it, then what we are seeking. </p>
            <p><b>"First human beings created god and then goodhearted human beings"</b></p>
            <p>So, now, how to settle our voracious search of seeking truth once and for all. The answer to that is inside this orb itself. Religion may be cogent, but it is no explanatory. It is some that vey uncanny. Coming back to our question, what is it? Lower of divine or figurine of its own creation? </p>
            <p>In 1950, two scientist <b>Stanley miller</b> and <b>Harold</b> very ratted the world with their bold experiment. They started an experiment to create life in a test tube. Their chemical being 'Primordial Soup' as found out by the research of scientists. There were lifeless chemicals that existed when nothing did. However, their research failed. They abandoned it and the test tube was kept in a locker. But, 'Life' gives many twists and turns. When a disciple of their after Miller's death ran some test with it, he found traces of RNA and quintessentially DNA.</p>
            <p>DNA, basically is what 'we' are. Apart from our physical structure, DNA is our mental basis. Our physical form can be reproduced overtire but our minds cannot be reproduced well, from the looks of it, it becomes clear, <b>'Humans come from nothing more nad so, everything.'</b> So if we take up the premedical soup and fast forward it millions of years, we can see like taking shake.</p>
            <p>This all even underpins the question, where are we going? Millions of years ago when ghhumansere in their early stages, there was a different spspecieshich dominated the earth. It was the species of dinosaurs. However, they wiped out from the face of Earth, millions of years ago. So can it happen to us too? And anthe answer is yes. It seems ignoble but it is untrue. I basically dedependpon our mettle for some time but it is ininevitableThe fa fast-growingechnoligical world is proof of it. In this world, we run after technology, in fast our bared on it so, itit'seally a chance that somebody the computers will take ous. This is what we call as <b>Artifical Intelligence</b>. So unless we limit our interactions with them, we've got a chance......</p>
