        <h3 id="topic">Girl Education: a neccessity</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>Education is a precious ornament for the valuable existence of girls. Girl's education means the appropriate enhancement in the personality of girls. Only the well-educated girls can better understand their miserable lot and can create consciousness about their rights and duties. India has been making a consistent effort to take girls' education. The emphasis all along has been to open up more opportunities for girls intellectual development. The effort has been made in all these years of planned development to enroll more girls' in school. Today for every 100 boys there are 62 girls in primary schools,43 girls in middle schools, 36 in secondary, school, and 31 in different stages of higher education. We can not neglect the education of girls' because they play an important in our life. The education of boys alone will not lead a nation to the proper verge of progress if girls remain ignorant and backward. If we teach a boy, we teach an individual but if we teach a girl, we teach a family. The girl as mother and wife exercises perhaps the greatest influence on the life of the man. The girl is the builder and molder of a nation's destiny. Though delicate and soft as the lily, she has a heart for stronger and bolder than a man. Suppose all the girls of a nation become educated properly,that country will become the abode of god. Though female literacy has gone up from 7.9% in 1951 to 39.3% in 1991,the absolute number of female illiterates has also gone up substantailly-a consequence of population  fall out. To secure better enrolment and retention of girls at different stages of education, the government provides scholarships, free textbooks, and uniforms. The vial subject of girls' education in the last two decades with the mounting awareness in the drive towards women's equality and emancipation.</p>
            <p>In ancient India the common belief was that women for homes and men for fields. But today's trend is completely changed as the number of girls attending colleges and universities has greatly increased. Girls are today venturing into different fields breaking the male monopoly in political,administration,science & technology and journalism arena. Today we can find women legislators, women ministers, women ambassadors, prime governorss and women prim ministers. There are women lawyers, doctors, teachers, clerks, and even women civil and military officers. Thus enjoying Indian women are enejoying equal political rights with men. Not only this,for a long time, women have also participated in great social service. In the sphere of social services there is a great woman 'Mother Teresa' who has changed <b>"the ugly and backward society into the abode of peace." </b> Down soutSivakasi drought-prone sivakasi in Tamil Nadu thousand of girls slog their days filling up match-boxes and making crackers of different kinds. Millions of little girl,s in UP, MP, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat are given away in marriage even before they are in their teens. For Girls', only their parent's education oly remains a luxury. The national perspective plan for women (1988-2000 AD) has suggested several measures to tackle the problem of the enrolment of girls and the unhealthy trend of dropout doing It appeals to media to do their best to promote this awareness among the masses on the importance of girls' education.</p>
            <p>Even many steps have been taken at the central and state levels. The National Council for Education Research and Training together with education departments of states has taken up several measures like <b>Early childhood Education Project, Non-formal Education Project, and the Primary Curriculum Renewal PRoject</b>, all designed to make education more relevant to children from the educationally backward areas. Similarly, the steps were taken by NCERT to provide free textbooks under the National Policy of Education, the massive teacher orientation program, which has so far converted 14 lakh teachers, the new curricular framework of the NCERT, the material provided for work experience and vocationalisation would all help in providing quality education for girls.</p>
            <p>There are many problems in such waa y. One is that about co-education. Some narrow-minded person are of the view that girls' and boys' should have separate education and they should have separate education and they should study separately. They think that co-education is the source of many evil among girls and boys. But I feel these arguments are weak and baselesss in modern percepfamiliaro-education makes girls nad boys' familar with one another and prepares them for co-operation if rightly conducted would also sexual restraint and give to the country fully developed men and women.</p>
            <p>Although the task ahead is gigantic and we cannot find an easy solution to a problem with wider <acronym titl. But if all the indians with their united effort become determined to abolish all the hindrance coming in the progress of girls' education and if our country leaves no stone unturned in the sphere of making all the girls and if our country leaves no stone unturned in the sphere of making all the girls educated then Nation's Literacy rate of girls and the development of our country will rapidly grow. If this dream is fulfilled,what a magnificent paradise our country will be just as a dreamland or Rab
