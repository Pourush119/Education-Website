        <section id="content">
            <p>In the geological history, many ages have passed since Homospaiens came into existence, and started ruling over the Earth. At the initial stage, the human species lived in harmony with nature or the Earth's environment. At that stage, man used to worship every civilization that evolved in any corner of the
                Earth. At that stage, which lasted for several millennia, there was no hostility or antagonism between
                man and nature.</p>
            <p>But ever since man self-assertive, he isolated himself from nature. He began to look upon nature as a
                means of his comfort. Then started the attempt to conquer and tame nature. The man began to mold nature according to his needs and wishes. With the event of population explosion in the human world, the process of molding nature gained momentum. Thus started the degradation of the environment. Each element in nature i.e. soil, water, air, the sound began to lose its purity. Each element eas subjected to exploitation for catering to the ever-increasing needs and desires of man. According to Mr.Lesler R.Brown, the author of 'The
                Global Economic Prospects', the Earth's principal biological systems are four fisheries, forest, grasslands and croplands. As a result of ruthless exploitation, fisheries are collapsing, forests are varnishing,
                grasslands are turning into barren wastelands, and croplands are deteriorating. Consequently,
                desertification and global warming are being experienced as the most serious threats to human existence.
            </p>
            <p>Besides adopting this predatory attitude towards nature, man is utilizing atomic energy more for destructive than constructive purposes. The huge stockpile of nuclear weapons, as made by man in modern times, is threatening the complete holocaust or extinction of the human race. Thus, the civilization, which man started building up very proudly and optimistically, with the aid of science and technology, has turned out to be suicidal. That is why the lamentation of the great nature-post Wordsworth seems to be quite
                relevant today.....</p>
