        <h3 id="topic">What i will become in my life ?</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p><b>"An aimless life is no life" </b></p>
            <p> I always think what i will become or what i will do in my life. I think these questions strikes in every mind. But it is true an aimless life is practically no life. A man without aim is like a ship without a <acronym
                    title=" a piece of wood or metal that is used for controlling the direction of boat or plane">rudder</acronym>
                or an engine without steam. One's ambition always determines his actions. We must therefore have some definite aim in life. That is, we must choose a definite profession. One who chooses no profession passes an unhappy
                life</p>
                <p>Now question strikes what are the need and factors for the right choice? The right choice of profession is very necessary. The right choice is the key to success in life. The question of choosing a profession was not very serious in the past. The son generally followed the profession of the father. But it is not possible now.
                    Time has changed, talent & tastes differ. Every profession can suit everyone. So, while choosing a
                    profession, we should keep in mind the natural taste, physical fitness, opinion and guidelines of
                    teachers, elders, and parents, the economic condition of the family, and prospects in the profession.
                    But yes the one big thing that will always describe us will be our passion and our determination towards anything. <b>" Would say if something doesn't allow you to sleep or focus on your work in your daily life then you must do that without thinking of its <acronym title="Failure or Success">
                        consequences."</acronym></b></p>
                        <p>Ellaborating it, everyone no matter how much poor or rich, old or young, intelligent or dull, dreams of a
                            rich future life. Some wish to become leaders, some desire to achieve power over nature & some dream of high position. I too have many ambitions. I also think on - "My ambition in life." I wish to be a doctor, my choice is according to my taste and talent. My family traditions also go in favor of my choice. In this profession, there is a great field for service. The doctor is second to none for a sick person. Secondly, this profession is an independent one. A
                            doctor gives his time, energy, and skill in curing the sick. From the very beginning, I dreamed to serve the poor people of my town. This profession of mine will give me enough chance to serve the people. I want to be an ideal doctor. Some doctors care more for their gains and less for their patients. They dream of a big mansion, a luxurious car, and other luxuries of life. I will keep away all such things from my mind. I shall not serve in any hospital but will start a <acronym
                            title=" a place where patients are treated, especially one run by the charity">dispensary</acronym> of my own. Kindness will always be my life aim. I shall give free medicine to the patients who are poor and needy.<br> My aim will be the speedy recovery of my patients.</p>
                            <p> Thus we can say that it is neither for money nor for a high position that I wish to be a doctor. It is something nobler than these. It is my wish to serve my fellow beings. I am sure of success as a doctor
                                because this is what my passions urge me .... </p>
