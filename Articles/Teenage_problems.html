            <p><b>"Intelligence and Character that is the goal of true Education"</b></p>
            <p><i>(Martin Luther King)</i></p>
            <p>He who opens a school door closes a prison. A school is a place responsible for a child's holistic growth of all-round development. It is obligatory to facilitate physical as well as mental growth. It not only nurture the child's academic growth but also inspires a child to reach the zenith of its etiquette, discipline, and courtesy. The motto of my school "He who loves Knowledge loves discipline" epitomes the sanctity of manners and discipline in one's life. Academic achievement and progress are invaluable in one's life and prone to be indispensable in one's career but the foundation of our attitude and character must also be robust and indomitable. This foundation is lain down in the student phase of one's life. These virtues help in attaining recognition, acknowledgment, and prestige in the society and are inducive of a successful life.</p>
            <p>"A disciplined mind leads to happiness and an undisciplined leads to unhappiness"</p>
            <p>This quote only compels me to quote about the state of turmoil among students.</p>
            <p>The delicacy of adolescence lies within that a student's mind tends to be more inclined towards immoralities rather than responsibilities. Moreover, the stringency of teacher and parents and their constant efforts to make them indulged in academics eventually results in their obstinacy and repugnance towards others. The burden of studies and exclusive syllabus causes them to be distressed and under this tremendous pressure, they become unaffected by the scolding of their parents. They become impulsive, relentless, and start retaliating to their elders aggressively. They become disrespectful and content towards the ones who are supposed to advise them. They strive to attain freedom from the clutches of academics. They become indulged in avocations and other inappropriate practices and deem studies a compulsion rather than a responsibility. </p>
               <p> Despite strictly urging them to work harder and aggravating their tension, parents and teachers should try to alleviate their stress by talking to them politely and considerately and gradually, permeate their downfall. They should experience themselves in their shoes and discuss their problems and difficulties with them patiently. Only then can we manifest the talents of youth and secure a brighter future....</p>
