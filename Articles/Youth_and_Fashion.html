        <h3 id="topic">Youth and Fassion</h3>
        <header id="content">
            <p>Youth is called the glorious period of life. In this period a child develops in his age. He is attracted more and more by things around him. He indulges more with his fellows in his student life. He grows in age and with time he starts to transform into a youth. During this transition from a student to a college boy, he tries to follow others and shine better with his looks.<b>"Youth-the golden period of life "</b> as discussed above is truly the most glamorous period in one's life. This is the period in which fascination begins overruling him. A youth even focuses more on his external show during his age of puberty. Either he moves on the road of making his future shine or his present shine by wearing the clothes of some peculiar and funny looks. Although a person should make the best use of his life during his youth face. </p>
            <p><b>Glamour of youth: </b>Youth is a period of glamour. Everybody wishes to look as good and attractive as he can. They watch television programs and copy the style of the virtual world's people. They showcase themselves with a similar style of walking, laughing, talking as they see infamous personalities. They even cover themselves with the dresses of the latest designs and cuts. They start chasing the new showy and  eye-catching dresses. This fashion is common to both puella and puer. Youth hide his own personality with other actions, hairs style, and even in the way of standing in a queue.</p>
            <p>What is the hidden reason behind it? I say their desires and emotions. Even a survey says 66% of youth have multiple desires in their heart. Even a child's heart is full of day-dreaming desires. However, these desires completely hunt one's nest during his youth period. They don't have a handful of desires. Even fashion for different age groups is different on a different basis. The fashion of looking tall, handsome is very common. For such even driving two-wheelers at high speed is a fashion. I even question god that they are forgotten their nationality and parents too. I see the fashion of talking to their parents in short English instead of showing respect to them in the Indian culture of-"Namaste". I am not saying that there is a harm in changing fashion. But "excess of everything is disastrous". I personally feel that the fashion craze must not go on rather craze for innovation and improving one's future should go on. Fashion has no fixed standard. There is so quick change in the fashion that the common man suffers to greatest extent. It becomes impractical for them to cope up with the latest fashion. </p>
            <p>I may conclude by mentioning that it is not a <b>wise step for a man to become a slave to fashion.</b> Rather than blindly following a fashion,<b>one must blindly start to think of his and community's future....</b></p>
