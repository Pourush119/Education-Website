        <h3 id="topic">Time Management:first pillar of success</h3>
        <section id="content">
            <p>"Time Management plays the most important role in success." This is the fact of which every one of us is aware but most of us keep <acronym title="">ignoring</acronym> it. Successful people have time to do what they want to do at their workplace or their homes and thus are capable of balancing work & home life, business, and <acronym title="">pleasure</acronym>, stress and stress relief.
                It will be important to keep in mind that time management does not mean trying to do everything at once but to sub-divide the task and <acronym title="">accomplish</acronym> them by a systematic approach. When
                the students are asked about organizing their daily or they will find a problem in making it as well as in
                <acronym title="">executing</acronym> their plan. Some people have a very clear picture of what problems they will find in making their plan as well as in <acronym title="">executing</acronym> it. And some people have a very clear picture of what they want to achieve today or in the future and how they going to do it. Unfortunately,soon after starting they get <acronym title="">distracted</acronym> thinking about
                something they should have done yesterday or about the plans. There might be some phone calls or e-mails after attending which you might have stayed away towards PC or about technological aids. They are there to help us and increase our efficiency but contrary to our belief they can be great time consumer also. When you start working on PC's there are many temptations. You might start by using a search engine
                to collect information on a particular topic but many times it happens that as the search engine is
                activated you start opening other files or e-mails with a mindset of saving times but it happens
                otherwise.</p>
            <p>It is quite often with students that their get <acronym title="">distracted</acronym> from their primary
                task and start <acronym title="">modifying</acronym> or printing the file content or send a reply to
                e-mails thus wasting their <acronym title="">invaluable </acronym>time while thinking that they have
                saved time. One of the problems with students is that they generally consider what their friend is doing at any given point in time, they start doing that. If you are preparing mathematics for your engineering entrance examination and your friend informs you about a new chemistry book or about solving a physics problem then what one would do? Eighty to ninety percent of the time you lose your concentration and start discussing with your friend about the new chemistry book or about solving the problem. To achieve the success you have to be disciplined and dedicated to acheiving your target. You have to implement the action plan which you have made to achieve your goal. Most of us make a very good strategy and also prepare our action-plan but become very <acronym title="">reluctant</acronym> or lazy when we have to implement it.
                Remember one has to pay the price for everything including "success!"</p>
            <p>Let's discuss some points that will give you more time to live your life the way you want to live it
                along with acheiving your objectives...</p>
            <h3>Step 1:Clearly know what you want to achieve</h3>
            <p>You must find answers to following questions :</p>
            <p>&#9679; What specific thing you want to acheive? <br>&#9679; Within what time you want to acheive. <br>
                &#9679; Dead-Line of acheiving your goal. <br> &#9679; Are your current eforts good enought to acheive
                success. <br> &#9679; Do you know what can be the possible hurdles and have you got a paln to overcome
                them.</p>
            <h3>Step 2:Making your strategy</h3>
            <p>Try to a plan a comprehensive strategy to acheive your objectives. YOu can then obtain desired result by
                making effort. Being <acronym title="">pro-active</acronym> will help in developing positive attitude
                which is very important for success. Set a <acronym title="">realistic</acronym> acheivable goal.</p>
            <p>&#9679; Go for short,clear goals that you want to acheive. <br> &#9679; Limit your goals to a few only.
                <br>
                &#9679; For a long-term or big goals, set targets along the way so that you can monitor your progress and
                take <acronym title="">remedial </acronym>steps in case if you are off-track.</p>
            <h3>Step 3:Measure your time:</h3>
            <p>Focus your attention on the smallest activities that leads to your objective.</p>
            <p>&#9679; Prepare a paln for each day on hourly/half houly basis. <br> &#9679; Stick to your plans. <br>
                &#9679; Check if you are <acronym title="">recative</acronym> or your planning is a reacton to
                something. <br> &#9679; Monitor your progress daily. </p>
            <h3>Step 4:Manage your health:</h3>
            <p> &#9679; Balance your life. <br> &#9679; Monitor your health and fitness level. <br> &#9679; Work out to
                achieve higher physical fitness. <br> &#9679; Develop a healthy life style. <br> &#9679; Learn to relax.
                <br> &#9679; Eat healthy & nutritous food.</p>
            <h3>Step 5:Say 'no' to monkeys:</h3>
            <p>Students have a habit of leaving their work and help others at the first call for help. You should become
                a litle selfish for:</p>
            <p>&#9679; You have to complete your homework. <br> &#9679; Your <acronym title="">adhocisim</acronym> may
                <acronym title="">derail </acronym>your entire plan. <br> &#9679; If you fail to do the above then it
                may lead to frustrtaion.</p>
            <h3>Step 6:Work in your prime time</h3>
            <p>Take maximum advantage of your periods of peak energy by indentifying those periods.</p>
            <p>&#9679; You should make asessment of your concentration and energy levels at different energy levels.
                <br> &#9679; IDentify the task that can be scheduled by keeping in mind your energy level at different time intervals. <br> &#9679; Identify the task that can be scheduled by keeping in mind your energy level and the energy required to do the work. <br> &#9679; Do the most important task t=at the peak of your
                energy level.</p>
            <h3>Step 7:Priortize your tasks </h3>
            <p>You should think peacefully and then <acronym title="">consiously</acronym> decide what to doa and what not to do based on your promise. This will help you help in: </p>
            <p>&#9679; Saving time by deciding to keep non-priority workout. &#9679; Result in fewer distractions. &#9679; Result in a more focused approach which will help you in achieving results with less amount of energy.</p>
            <p>As a student you should realize that time and energy are not infinite. Successful persons always respect the time and conserve their energy. Thus the I really feels that with proper time management and comprehensive strategy student can become successful in achieving whatever goal which they want to set for themselves.</p>
