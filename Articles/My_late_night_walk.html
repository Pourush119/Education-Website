        <section id="content">
            <p>All a rainy season and rainy season's night. Animals whistling at night and I was trembling with fear. I was only by my shadow and forest on both sides. The element of terror and horror was well suited to me. Although the entire path was very much lighted with street lights but still advancing path made me shake more and I even on a
                windy and cool night was sweating badly. I had my mobile phone but the battery dead. I got remembered of all fearful and terror scenes of movies and even realized that phone battery going dead during such scenes do happen in real life. Apart from movies my thoughts too were advancing towards the ghost stories told by my friends. Jane had told me a story of the ghost before night only. I tried ways to build courage in me but couldn't. Fears don't end here. Suddenly I saw one more shadow, beside me one step ahead. I ranked my present situation as the most fearful one a 13-year-old boy has ever faced. 06 had gone and now had filled me more fear. After 10 minutes I again saw that shadow but this time on my left. This was the first time I swayed to god that I would leave my phone if I reached my home safely without being attacked by any ghost. With advancing time, my heartbeat and the number of shadows surrounding me were increasing and I was blank whose it was. I was increasing my speed by increasing the number of shadows. On my terrorful journey through the forest, I felt sorry for not listening to my parent's world hours back.
                Exactly before 6 hours, my parents instructed me not to go out for a late-night birthday party of Jane.
                That time I didn't listen to them but now I was regretting. I blamed Jane for all this as he was the one to organize a late-night birthday party. It seemed that as more and more I was blaming the jane number of shadows was increasing. From 2 or 3 they were now over 10. I started running more faster and faster and after a hard struggle with the black speechless being. I was so scared that in 2 seconds I rang the bell more than 10 times. A very loud shout came from inside for opening the door from my Mom. Even after reaching the door of my house, I was breathing super fast. The door opened and I shouted very loudly this time after seeing my mom heavily laden with makeup at midnight. Guess what I realized. I had identified the most fearful thing in this world.</p>
