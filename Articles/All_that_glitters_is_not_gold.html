        <section id="content">
            <p>"All that glitters is not gold" the very right phrase of William Shakespeare. The following phrase tells us a very important truth of this world. It speaks more than we can assume. From the crisis in the poor's life to luxury in the rich's life, from political to economical problems the phrase is very true. The phrase means <b>outer appearances are often deceptive.</b> Things looking attractive and showy from outside may posses a threat from inside. Threat - a word that often attacks a person who is fascinated by some deceiving beauty. Let's take it with an example.</p>
            <p>China,a very powerful nation in all ways. It may be not so in the past but now developing at a very high rate to the peak. One might wonder how but it's just the game of "all that glitters is not gold". China extends his hand of friendship and helps to different and less developed nations. After this, it starts selling its products at a cheap price. People get fascinated by low prices and china executes its game of being glittery. It expands and expands its capital and countries don't realize when they are getting overruled by some external power. Finally, it plays its game of threat and may ask of a huge sum or attack that country to conquer it leaving the nation with almost nothing. This is what all that glitters is not gold means. From the attractive beauty to deceiving nature simply it is glittery gold.</p>
            <p>We even find beautiful women around us. We get attracted by it unknowing of the fact that their beauty might be purchased with weight. This Means it brings a magnificent change in their looks by using cosmetics. Even a poor puts some or the other charming mask in order to earn some living. One easily get deceived by something glittery. We without examining anything till its depth and starts relying on it. Thus they are plenty of examples and we are just surrounded by most.</p>
            <p>After long analysis you might have a question ? Does all the gold appearance have some threat inside? I say no, you just need to examine things rightly. If we see victims of cyber-attacks then we find that they are first attracted by hackers through free money offers and then defrauded by them. We just believe in them without having complete knowledge. We just need to imagine future circumstances in a more smart way and examine them. We need to see that threats are more often under some illumnating stuff, it is we who need to be clever. I personally think <b>it's all about extending the knowledge of people and expand the scope and scale of consciousness and then we may be better able to ask write questions, that's only the way to move forward and save yourself from beautiful threats. Just think as it is the only way to gain more with lose less</b></p>
